DORCUS CLOCK: Digital wall Clock Project
Overview
 This is a customized clock using HTML, CSS,SVG,(Scalable Vector Graphics), JavaScript. 
1. HTML Structure:
    * I created and named "index.html" that contains the basic HTML structure.
    * Decided to name it "DORCUS CLOCK".
2. JavaScript (updateClock function):
    * This function is responsible for updating the clock hands.
    * It gets the current time using new Date().
    * It calculates the angles for hour, minute, and second hands based on the current time.
    * The function then uses document.getElementById() to select each clock hand element and applies a rotation transform to position them correctly.
3. Clock Update Mechanism:
    * setInterval(updateClock, 1000) is used to call the updateClock function every 1000 milliseconds (1 second), ensuring the clock updates in real-time.
    * updateClock() is called immediately to set the initial position of the clock hands.
4. SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)Clock Face:
    * An SVG element with id "clock" is defined, creating the visual representation of the clock.
     It includes:
        * A circle for the clock face
        * Four lines representing hour marks at 12, 3, 6, and 9 o'clock positions
        * Three lines with ids "hourHand", "minuteHand", and "secondHand" representing the clock hands

SVG-based design for crisp graphics at any scale
Minimalist interface with hour markers and numbers for easy reading
Smooth animation of clock hands

Implementation Details
Technologies Used

HTML: Provides the structure for the web page
SVG: Creates the visual elements of the clock face and hands
JavaScript: Handles the real-time updating of the clock
CSS: designs and brightter looks

Key Components

Clock Face: An SVG circle with hour markers and numbers at 12, 3, 6, and 9 o'clock positions.
Clock Hands: Three SVG lines representing the hour, minute, and second hands.
JavaScript Function: updateClock() calculates the current time and positions the clock hands accordingly.
Interval Timer: Ensures the clock updates every second for real-time accuracy.
